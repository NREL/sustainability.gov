            <p>President Biden's Executive Order 14057 on catalyzing American clean energy industries and jobs through Federal sustainability and accompanying Federal Sustainability Plan (collectively referred to as "The Federal Sustainability Plan") establishes an ambitious path to achieve a net-zero emissions buildings goal by 2045. The Federal Government will work across new building construction, major renovations, and existing real property to electrify systems, decrease energy use, reduce water consumption and cut waste. Federal agencies will set ambitious, data-driven 2030 goals and annual targets for energy and water reductions, based on leading performance benchmarks for building type categories and the composition of the agency's building portfolio. As part of this strategy, the Federal Government will use performance contracting to reduce emissions, improve efficiency, and modernize facilities while delivering financial savings.</p>

In addition, agencies will reduce or minimize the use of toxic and hazardous chemicals and materials, particularly where such reduction will assist the agency in reducing their GHG emissions.</p>

                <p>The Federal Government also will leverage its footprint of leased space to drive greater sustainability in the building sector. All new and renewed leases over 25,000 RSF, where the Federal Government occupies at least 75 percent of the building, and that are entered into after September 30, 2023, will be green leases, as defined by GSA. They will require the lessor to report to the agency lessee annual data on facility GHG emissions, energy and water consumption, and waste generation. By 2030, all leases greater than 25,000 RSF will be net-zero emissions buildings.</p>
