          <h2 id="about">About the Federal Buy Clean Initiative</h2>
          <p>The Federal Government is the largest purchaser in the world, with annual purchasing power of over $650 billion. To harness that procurement power to support low-carbon, made in America materials, President's Biden charged his Administration through his December 2021 <a href="../federalsustainabilityplan/index.html">Federal Sustainability Plan</a> and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/08/executive-order-on-catalyzing-clean-energy-industries-and-jobs-through-federal-sustainability/">Executive Order 14057</a> to launch a Buy Clean Task Force and initiative to promote use of low-carbon, made in America construction materials. Through Buy Clean, the Federal Government will for the first time prioritize the use of American-made, lower-carbon construction materials in Federal procurement and Federally-funded projects, which will advance America's industrial capacity to supply the goods and materials of the future while growing good jobs for American workers.</p>
          <h2 id="abouttaskforce">About the Buy Clean Task Force</h2>
          <p>Established under Executive Order (E.O.) 14057 on Federal Sustainability, the Buy Clean Task Force is co-chaired by the <a href="../mayock.html">Federal Chief Sustainability Officer</a> and the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/odcp/">White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy</a>. The Task Force includes representatives from the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Interior, State and Transportation; the Environmental Protection Agency; the General Services Administration; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the Veterans Administration; the White House Office of Management and Budget; and the White House Domestic Climate Policy Council. Together, the Task Force agencies account for 90% of all federally-financed and purchased construction materials.</p>
          <p>The Buy Clean Task Force is charged with developing recommendations on policies and procedures to expand consideration of <a href="#faqs">embodied emissions</a> and pollutants of construction materials in Federal procurement and federally funded projects, which includes:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Identifying materials, such as steel and concrete, as well as pollutants to prioritize for consideration in Federal procurement and federally-funded projects;</li>
            <li>Increasing the transparency of embodied emissions through supplier reporting, including incentives and technical assistance to help domestic manufacturers better report and reduce embodied emissions; and,</li>
            <li>Launching pilot programs to boost federal procurement of clean construction materials.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          <div class="accordion-container">
					  <a href="#whatare" class="header" data-toggle="collapse">What are embodied emissions?</a>
					  <div id="whatare" class="collapse">
							<br />
              <p>Embodied emissions refer to the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the extraction, production, transport, and manufacturing of material. Low embodied carbon materials have less climate impact associated with mining, manufacturing and transportation. Traditionally, steel, concrete, asphalt, and flat glass contain a high quantity of embodied emissions due to the energy-intensive processes used to extract raw materials like limestone, taconite ore, and silica and then converting those raw materials via industrial processes to produce an end product.  </p>

          <div class="accordion-container">
					  <a href="#whatis" class="header" data-toggle="collapse">What is Buy Clean?</a>
					  <div id="whatis" class="collapse">
							<br />
              <p>Buy Clean is a procurement policy to promote the purchase of construction materials and products with lower embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, taking into account the life-cycle emissions associated with the production of those materials.</p>
					  </div>

          <div class="accordion-container">
					  <a href="#why" class="header" data-toggle="collapse">Why Buy Clean? </a>
					  <div id="why" class="collapse">
							<br />
              <p>Today, the U.S. manufacturing sector is responsible for nearly a third of U.S. GHG emissions, with the production of steel, concrete, asphalt, and flat glass accounting for nearly half of all U.S. manufacturing GHG emissions. By leveraging the Federal Government's massive purchasing power to support the purchase of American-made steel, concrete, asphalt, and flat glass products with lower embodied emissions, the Federal Government can provide a large and stable signal necessary to advancing the country's industrial capacity to supply the goods and materials of the future while growing good jobs for American workers and significantly reducing the country's greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

          <div class="accordion-container">
					  <a href="#how" class="header" data-toggle="collapse">How are materials and products determined to be "lower embodied emissions"?</a>
					  <div id="how" class="collapse">
							<br />
              <p>Based on a recognition of industry best practice, the Federal Buy Clean Initiative is using product-specific type III Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) as the primary data source for implementation. EPDs take into account a life cycle analysis of multiple environmental impacts, including GHGs at all stages of production. EPDs are similar to nutrition labels on a food product but focus on a materials' environmental and sustainable attributes. The Buy Clean Task Force will continue to identify and pursue opportunities to improve EPDs to ensure they are suitable, consistent and comparable for integration into Federal procurement policies. This information can be supplemented by facility-level energy efficiency benchmarking data such as ENERGY STAR Energy Performance Indicators for industrial plants.</p>

          <div class="accordion-container">
					  <a href="#howdoes" class="header" data-toggle="collapse">How does Buy Clean integrate with Federal climate smart infrastructure goals?</a>
					  <div id="howdoes" class="collapse">
							<br />
              <p>The Federal Government has made great progress in considering the overall climate impacts of new and upgraded construction projects, including applying integrative design principles, whole project life cycle assessment, and sustainable pavements tools. Agencies have also begun to investigate using innovative materials, such as structural mass timber and wood products, that can drastically lower the overall carbon footprint of a building. Buy Clean complements these efforts by ensuring that when designing clean, energy-efficient, net zero infrastructure we are not forgetting the "embodied emissions" in the construction materials that can be equal to the emissions generated over decades of operating the building.</p>
