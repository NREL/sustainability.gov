          <p>In December 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order that directed the Federal Government to use its scale and procurement power to achieve the following fve ambitious goals:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li>100 percent carbon pollution-free electricity (CFE) by 2030, at least half of which will be locally supplied clean energy to meet 24/7 demand;</li>
            <li>100 percent zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) acquisitions by 2035, including 100 percent zero-emission light-duty vehicle acquisitions by 2027;</li>
            <li>Net-zero emissions from Federal procurement;</li>
            <li>A net-zero emissions building portfolio by 2045, including a 50 percent emissions reduction by 2032; and</li>
            <li>Net-zero emissions from overall Federal operations by 2050, including a 65 percent emissions reduction by 2030.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In addition to the fve new commitments that form the pillars of the executive action, the President also directed the Federal Government to orient its procurement and operations eforts in line with the following principles and goals:</p>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Climate resilient infrastructure and operations;</li>
            <li>A climate- and sustainability-focused workforce;</li>
            <li>Advancing environmental justice and equity;</li>
            <li>Prioritizing the purchase of sustainable products, such as products without added perfuoroalkyl or polyfuoroalkyl substances (PFAS); and</li>
            <li>Accelerating progress through domestic and international partnerships.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This executive action is a part of the President's broader commitment to increasing investments in America's manufacturing industries and workers in order to Build Back Better.</p>
          <p>By transforming how the Federal Government builds, buys, and manages its assets and operations, the Federal Government will support the growth of America's clean energy and clean technology industries, while accelerating America's progress toward achieving a carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035.</p>
          <p>President Biden's executive order will create good-paying union jobs and provide a strong foundation for American businesses to compete and win globally in the clean energy economy. Today's executive action further reinforces the President's directive to Buy American and ensure that equity and environmental justice are key considerations in Federal operations planning and decision making.</p>
          <h2>Catalyzing America's Clean Energy Industries and Jobs through Federal Sustainability Executive Order</h2>
          <p>Through this Executive Order, the Federal Government will leverage its portfolio of 300,000 buildings, feet of 600,000 cars and trucks, and annual purchasing power of $650 billion goods and services to:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Transition Federal infrastructure to zero-emission vehicles and buildings powered by carbon pollution-free electricity, which will reduce the Federal Government's greenhouse gas emissions by 65 percent by 2030.</li>
            <li>Make Federal agencies more adaptive and resilient to the impacts of climate change, and increase the sustainability of Federal supply chains, achieving net-zero emissions from Federal procurement by 2050.</li>
            <li> Mainstream sustainability within the Federal workforce, advance equity and environmental justice, and leverage partnerships to accelerate progress.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Transition Federal infrastructure to zero-emission vehicles and energy efficient buildings powered by carbon pollution-free electricity. These changes will enable the Federal Government to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 65 percent by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050:</h3>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li><b>Achieve 100 percent carbon pollution-free electricity use by 2030, including 50 percent on a 24/7 basis.</b> The Federal Government will work with utilities, developers, technology firms, financiers and others to purchase electricity produced from resources that generate no carbon emissions, including solar and wind, for all its operations by 2030. Half of the Federal Government's 100 percent carbon pollution-free annual electricity demand will be procured on a 24/7 basis, meaning that the Federal Government's real-time demand for electricity will be met with clean energy every hour, every day, and produced within the same regional grid where the electricity is consumed. With the scope and scale of this electricity demand, the Federal Government expects it will catalyze the development of at least 10 gigawatts of new American clean electricity production by 2030, spurring the creation of new union jobs and moving the country closer to achieving a carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035.</li>
            <li><b>Transition to 100 percent acquisition of zero-emission vehicles by 2035 for the Federal vehicle feet, including 100 percent light duty vehicle acquisition by 2027.</b> The Federal Government will work with American vehicle, battery, and charging equipment manufacturers and installers to become the largest zero-emission vehicle feet in the Nation, reaching 100 percent zero-emission vehicle acquisitions by 2035. This will accelerate the advancement of America's industrial capacity to supply zero-emission vehicles and electric vehicle batteries and create and sustain good union jobs in manufacturing, engineering, and skilled-trades.</li>
            <li><b>Modernize the Federal buildings portfolio to reach net-zero emissions by 2045, including a 50 percent reduction in building emissions by 2032.</b> The Federal Government will work across existing real property and during new building construction and major renovations to increase water and energy efficiency, reduce waste, electrify systems, and promote sustainable locations for Federal facilities to strengthen the vitality and livability of the communities in which Federal facilities are located. Additionally, the Biden-Harris Administration will implement the frst-ever Federal Building Performance Standard, and will use performance contracting to improve buildings with no up-front costs.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Make Federal agencies more adaptive and resilient to the impacts of climate change, and increase the sustainability of Federal supply chains, achieving net-zero emissions from Federal procurement by 2050.</h3>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li><b>Make Federal agencies more adaptive and resilient to the impacts of climate change.</b> The intensifying impacts of climate change present physical, operational, and financial risks to Federal infrastructure, agency missions, and our services to the American people. Agencies will implement the actions identifed through their October 7, 2021, Climate Adaptation and Resilience Plans and modernize Federal policy, programs, operations, and infrastructure to support climate resilience investment. By taking action now to better manage and mitigate climate risks, we will minimize future disruptions and destruction to Federal operations, assets and programs and ensure the Federal Government can continue providing critical services to the Nation.</li>
            <li><b>Increase the sustainability of Federal supply chains, achieving net-zero emissions from Federal procurement by 2050.</b> The companies that supply the Federal Government are critical partners in achieving our climate goals and growing the economy and American jobs. Major Federal suppliers will be required to measure and disclose their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and set science-based GHG reduction targets. Cutting emissions from the Federal Government's procurement also means buying materials with a lower carbon footprint. The Federal Government will launch a "buy clean" initiative for low-carbon materials and prioritize the purchase of sustainable products, such as products without added perfuoroalkyl or polyfuoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Through these actions, the Federal Government will provide a large and stable signal to the market for sustainable and low-carbon goods made in America, advancing America's industrial capacity to supply the goods and materials of the future while growing good jobs for American workers.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Mainstreaming sustainability within the Federal workforce, advance equity and environmental justice, and leverage partnerships to accelerate progress.</h3>
          <img src="../../../images/execsummary-workforce.jpg" alt="Worker in safety gear" border="0" class="right"/>
          <ul class="bullets">
            <li><b>Mainstream sustainability within the Federal workforce.</b> The Federal Government's 4.2 million employees are critical stakeholders and leaders in the shift to sustainable and resilient operations. The Federal Government will build capacity through engagement, education, and training so that Federal workers are ready to embed sustainability, climate adaptation, and environmental stewardship analysis and action in their jobs as we work to Build Back Better.</li>
            <li><b>Advance equity and environmental justice.</b> The Federal Government will advance the goals of the Administration's Justice40 Initiative by ensuring that economic equity and environmental justice are key considerations in operations planning and decision making. A Federal environmental justice representative will serve on the newly-established Federal Chief Sustainability Ofcer Council. To incorporate equity, agencies will support the President's Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, which helps ensure that government contracting and procurement opportunities are available on an equal basis.</li>
            <li><b>Leverage partnerships to accelerate progress.</b> Collaboration with leading American unions, businesses, States, Tribes, municipalities, and other countries will accelerate progress and catalyze greater climate action at home and abroad. The Federal Government will build upon its newly-launched Greening Government Initiative that convenes governments around the world in greening government operations. Further, the Administration will launch a Presidential Sustainability Executives Program, placing senior leaders from the private and non-proft sectors to serve across the Federal Government, bringing innovative perspectives and critical expertise to achieve these ambitious, and imperative, sustainability and climate preparedness goals.</li>
